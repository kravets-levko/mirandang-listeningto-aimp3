# AIMP3 Support for Miranda NG ListeningTo plugin

## Overview

This is a plugin for AIMP3 (currently tested with AIMP ver. 3.60) that allows to send information about current track to MirandaNG ListeningTo plugin. **Note!** This plugin does not support other versions of AIMP player (not AIMP2 nor AIMP4) and also may not work with MirandaIM _(I didn't test it since MirandaIM is almost dead. But you can try)_.

Plugin can send information about regular music files and radio stations.
